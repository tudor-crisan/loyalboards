# Component Architecture

The project's component architecture is designed for a multi-tenant, white-labeled environment, where the same UI code can change its appearance and behavior based on configuration.

## 1. Components Hierarchy

UI components are organized into a strict hierarchy:

1. **Wrappers (`/components/wrapper`)**: Global context providers that inject styling, authentication, and layout rules.
2. **Common Primitives (`/components/common`)**: Shared, design-consistent building blocks (Flex, Grid, Title, Modal).
3. **Module-Specific UI**: Feature-specific components (`/components/blog`, `/components/dashboard`).
4. **App-Specific Overrides (`/components/apps`)**: Components that are unique to a single application in the boilerplate.

## 2. Core Patterns

### The Wrapper Chain

The application is wrapped in a chain of providers that coordinate the "look and feel":

- **`WrapperStyling`**: Injects the design tokens from `styling.json` into a React context.
- **`WrapperAuth`**: Manages the user session and handles optimistic profile updates (including real-time styling changes).
- **`WrapperBody`**: Ensures standard responsive padding and alignment across all pages.

### Design Consistency

Instead of hardcoding Tailwind classes, "Common" components often source their defaults from the `styling` context:

```javascript
// Example: Flex.js sources its alignment from the config
const { styling } = useStyling();
return <div className={styling.flex.center}>{children}</div>;
```
